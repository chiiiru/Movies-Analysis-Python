# Movies-Analysis-Python

Data Acquisition:

I found a reliable source to obtain the movie data from IMDb. This involved accessing IMDb datasets available online.
I downloaded necessary movie data in a suitable format, CSV.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

I loaded the acquired data into a DataFrame using the pandas library.
explored the DataFrame to understand its structure, column names, and data types.
cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies or errors.
converted columns to appropriate data types if needed.
performed any necessary data transformations or feature engineering, such as splitting or extracting relevant information from columns.
Data Analysis:

I identified the key questions or areas of analysis to be explored with the movie data. For example, analyzing movie genres, ratings, release years, or box office performance.
